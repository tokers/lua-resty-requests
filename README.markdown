Status
======

This Lua module is currently considered experimental.

Synopsis
========

```lua
local requests = require "resty.requests"

-- example url
local url = "http://example.com/index.html"

local r, err = requests.get(url)
if not r then
    ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
    return
end

-- read all body
local body = r:body()
ngx.print(body)

-- or you can iterate the response body
-- while true do
--     local chunk, err = r:iter_content(4096)
--     if not chunk then
--         ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
--         return
--     end
--
--     if chunk == "" then
--         break
--     end
--
--     ngx.print(chunk)
-- end

-- you can also use the non-stream mode
-- local opts = {
--     stream = false
-- }
--
-- local r, err = requests.get(url, opts)
-- if not r then
--     ngx.log(ngx.ERR, err)
-- end
--
-- ngx.print(r.content)
```

Methods
=======

### request

**syntax**: *local r, err = requests.request(method, url, opts?)*

This is the pivotal method in `lua-resty-requests`, it will return a [response object](#response-object) `r`. In the case of failure, `nil`, and a Lua string which describles the corresponding error will be given.

The first parameter `method`, is the HTTP method that you want to use(same as
HTTP's semantic), which takes a Lua string and the value can be:

* `GET`
* `HEAD`
* `POST`
* `PUT`
* `DELETE`
* `OPTIONS`
* `PATCH`

The second parameter `url`, just takes the literal meaning(i.e. Uniform Resource Location),
for instance, `http://foo.com/blah?a=b`, you can omit the scheme prefix and as the default scheme,
`http` will be selected.

The third param, an optional Lua table, which contains a number of  options:

* `headers` holds the custom request headers.

* `allow_redirects` specifies whether redirecting to the target url(specified by `Location` header) or not when the status code is `301`, `302`, `303`, `307` or `308`.

* `redirect_max_times` specifies the redirect limits, default is `10`.

* `body`, the request body, can be:
    * a Lua string, or
    * a Lua function, without parameter and returns a piece of data (string) or an empty Lua string to represent EOF, or
    * a Lua table, each key-value pair will be concatenated with the "&", and Content-Type header will `"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`

* `error_filter`, holds a Lua function which takes two parameters, `state` and `err`.
 the parameter `err` describes the error and `state` is always one of these values(represents the current stage):
    * `requests.CONNECT`
    * `requests.HANDSHAKE`
    * `requests.SEND_HEADER`
    * `requests.SEND_BODY`
    * `requests.RECV_HEADER`
    * `requests.RECV_BODY`
    * `requests.CLOSE`

You can use the method [requests.state](#state) to get the textual meaning of these values.


* `timeouts`, an array-like table, `timeouts[1]`, `timeouts[2]` and `timeouts[3]` represents `connect timeout`, `send timeout` and `read timeout` respectively (in seconds).

* `http10` specify whether the `HTTP/1.0` should be used, default verion is `HTTP/1.1`.
* `http20` specify whether the `HTTP/2` should be used, default verion is `HTTP/1.1`.

Note this is still unstable, caution should be exercised. Also, there are some
limitations, see [lua-resty-http2](https://github.com/tokers/lua-resty-http2) for the details.

* `ssl` holds a Lua table, with three fields:
  * `verify`, controls whether to perform SSL verification
  * `server_name`, is used to specify the server name for the new TLS extension Server Name Indication (SNI)

* `proxies` specify proxy servers, the form is like

```lua
{
    http = { host = "127.0.0.1", port = 80 },
    https = { host = "192.168.1.3", port = 443 },
}
```

When using HTTPS proxy, a preceding CONNECT request will be sent to proxy server.

* `hooks`, also a Lua table, represents the hook system that you can use to
manipulate portions of the request process. Available hooks are:
  * `response`, will be triggered immediately after receiving the response headers

you can assign Lua functions to hooks, these functions accept the [response object](#response-object) as the unique param.

```lua
local hooks = {
    response = function(r)
        ngx.log(ngx.WARN, "during requests process")
    end
}
```

Considering the convenience, there are also some "short path" options:

* `auth`, to do the Basic HTTP Authorization, takes a Lua table contains `user` and `pass`, e.g. when `auth` is:

```lua
{
    user = "alex",
    pass = "123456"
}
```

Request header `Authorzation` will be added, and the value is `Basic YWxleDoxMjM0NTY=`.

* `json`, takes a Lua table, it will be serialized by `cjson`, the serialized data will be sent as the request body, and it takes the priority when both `json` and `body` are specified.

* `cookie`, takes a Lua table, the key-value pairs will be organized according to the `Cookie` header's rule, e.g. `cookie` is:

```lua
{
    ["PHPSESSID"] = "298zf09hf012fh2",
    ["csrftoken"] = "u32t4o3tb3gg43"
}
```

The `Cookie` header will be `PHPSESSID=298zf09hf012fh2; csrftoken=u32t4o3tb3gg43 `.

* `stream`, takes a boolean value, specifies whether reading the body in the stream mode, and it will be true by default. 

### state
**syntax**: *local state_name = requests.state(state)*

The method is used for getting the textual meaning of these values:

 * `requests.CONNECT`
 * `requests.HANDSHAKE`
 * `requests.SEND_HEADER`
 * `requests.SEND_BODY`
 * `requests.RECV_HEADER`
 * `requests.RECV_BODY`
 * `requests.CLOSE`

a Lua string `"unknown"` will be returned if `state` isn't one of the above values.

### get
**syntax**: *local r, err = requests.get(url, opts?)*

Sends a HTTP GET request. This is identical with

```lua
requests.request("GET", url, opts)
```

### head
**syntax**: *local r, err = requests.head(url, opts?)*

Sends a HTTP HEAD request. This is identical with

```lua
requests.request("HEAD", url, opts)
```

### post
**syntax**: *local r, err = requests.post(url, opts?)*

Sends a HTTP POST request. This is identical with

```lua
requests.request("POST", url, opts)
```

### put
**syntax**: *local r, err = requests.put(url, opts?)*

Sends a HTTP PUT request. This is identical with

```lua
requests.request("PUT", url, opts)
```

### delete
**syntax**: *local r, err = requests.delete(url, opts?)*

Sends a HTTP DELETE request. This is identical with

```lua
requests.request("DELETE", url, opts)
```

### options
**syntax**: *local r, err = requests.options(url, opts?)*

Sends a HTTP OPTIONS request. This is identical with

```lua
requests.request("OPTIONS", url, opts)
```

### patch
**syntax**: *local r, err = requests.patch(url, opts?)*

Sends a HTTP PATCH request. This is identical with

```lua
requests.request("PATCH", url, opts)
```

Response Object
===============

Methods like `requests.get` and others will return a response object `r`, which can be manipulated by the following methods and variables:

* `url`, the url passed from caller
* `method`, the request method, e.g. `POST`
* `status_line`, the raw status line(received from the remote)
* `status_code`, the HTTP status code
* `http_version`, the HTTP version of response, e.g. `HTTP/1.1`
* `headers`, a Lua table represents the HTTP response headers(case-insensitive)
* `close`, holds a Lua function, used to close(keepalive) the underlying TCP connection
* `drop`, is a Lua function, used for dropping the unread HTTP response body, will be invoked automatically when closing (if any unread data remains)
* `iter_content`, which is also a Lua function, emits a part of response body(decoded from chunked format) each time called. 

This function accepts an optional param `size` to specify the size of body that the caller wants, when absent, `iter_content` returns `8192` bytes when the response body is plain or returns a piece of chunked data if the resposne body is chunked.

In case of failure, `nil` and a Lua string described the error will be returned.

* `body`, also holds a Lua function that returns the whole response body.

* `content`, the response body, only valid in the non-stream mode.

In case of failure, `nil` and a Lua string described the error will be returned.

* `elapsed`, a hash-like Lua table which represents the cost time (in seconds) for each stage.
  * `elapsed.connect`, cost time for the TCP 3-Way Handshake;
  * `elapsed.handshake`, cost time for the SSL/TLS handshake (if any);
  * `elapsed.send_header`, cost time for sending the HTTP request headers;
  * `elapsed.send_body`, cost time for sending the HTTP request body (if any);
  * `elapsed.read_header`, cost time for receiving the HTTP response headers;
  * `elapsed.ttfb`, the time to first byte.

Note When HTTP/2 protocol is applied, the `elapsed.send_body` (if any) will be same as `elapsed.send_header`.

Session
=======

A session persists some data across multiple requests, like cookies data, authorization data and etc.

This mechanism now is still experimental.

A simple example:

```lua
s = requests.session()
local r, err = s:get("https://www.example.com")
ngx.say(r:body())
```

A session object has same interfaces with `requests`, i.e. those http methods.

TODO

* other interesting features...
